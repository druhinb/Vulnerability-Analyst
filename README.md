## Vulnerability Analyst

This is a quick project I built that lets you query the National Vulnerability Database.

### Geting Started

First, make sure you have `conda` or `mamba` installed. Then, in the source directory, run:

```sh
mamba install -f environment.yaml
```

This will create a new environment called "vulnbot". Now, run:

```sh
mamba activate vulnbot
```

You're all set up to start using the chatbot! Simply run:

```
python model.py
```

Run with the `--help` flag to get a list of configurables. In particular, the `--model` flag should take one of three forms:

```sh
python model.py --model "openai" # run with openai model, requires openAI api key
python model.py --model "hf:source/model_name/model_file.gguf" # download model from huggingface
python model.py --model "local:~/models/model_file.gguf" # use local checkpoints to run
```

Make sure to also create a `.env` file with your API keys like so:

```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>
NVD_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>
```
